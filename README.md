# Todolist Application

My very first Node application. A todolist restful CRUD API application built using Node.js, Express and MongoDB.

## Steps to Setup

1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

2. Run Server

```bash
node index.js
```

You can browse the apis at <http://localhost:3000/api/tasks>
